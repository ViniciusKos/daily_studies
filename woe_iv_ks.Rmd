# Motivation


-test address the problem of findout whether or not the difference between two groups is significant

assumptions:
for smaller samples the normality is needed, whereas from larger samples, the CLT assures justify the t-test even if the distribution is non normal
independent two sample test assumes equal variance, conversely, weich t-test doesn't


```{r}
# Load necessary libraries

library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(pwr)

# Generate toy dataset
set.seed(123)  # for reproducibility
data1 <- rnorm(50, mean = 100, sd = 30)  # first sample
data2 <- rnorm(50, mean = 110, sd = 15)  # second sample

# Normality test - Shapiro-Wilk test
shapiro.test(data1)
shapiro.test(data2)

# Perform t-test
t_test_result <- t.test(data1, data2, var.equal = TRUE)  # assuming equal variance

# Output results
print(t_test_result)

# Effect size - Cohen's d
effect_size <- (mean(data1) - mean(data2)) / sqrt(((49 * var(data1)) + (49 * var(data2))) / 50)
print(paste("Effect size (Cohen's d):", effect_size))

# If the null hypothesis is in the confidence interval (0 differences between the mean), there's a a  evidence that it it is true.

# Test power calculation
pwr_result <- pwr.t.test(n = 50, 
                         d = effect_size, 
                         sig.level = t_test_result$p.value, 
                         type = "two.sample", 
                         alternative = "two.sided")
print(pwr_result)

# Confidence intervals
conf_int <- t_test_result$conf.int
print(paste("Confidence Intervals:", conf_int[1], "to", conf_int[2]))
